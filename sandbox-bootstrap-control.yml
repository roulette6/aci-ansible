# This playbook is meant to be a simple bootstrap of an ACI sandbox
# once the fabric has been discovered. The playbook expects a small
# fabric with spine-201, leaf-201, and leaf-202. The playbook will
# launch two playbooks to create access policies and tenants with
# their additional objects

# ansible-playbook sandbox-bootstrap-control.yml --extra-vars "apic=aci.vm.jm"

# - name: "Launch sandbox-bootstrap-fabric.yml and sandbox-bootstrap-tenant.yml"
#   hosts: "{{ apic }}"
#   ignore_errors: true
